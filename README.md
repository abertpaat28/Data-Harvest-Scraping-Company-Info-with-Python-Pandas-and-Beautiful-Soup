# Data-Harvest-Scraping-Company-Info-with-Python-Pandas-and-Beautiful-Soup

**Data Collection:**
I used Python libraries like Pandas and Beautiful Soup for web scraping. These tools are great for extracting structured data from websites.

By scraping data from a real website, I was able to collect information about the top 100 largest companies by revenue, the top 10 largest private companies, and the top 10 most profitable companies.


**Tools Used:**
Jupyter Notebook was an excellent choice for testing and executing my Python code. Its interactive environment allowed me to explore and analyze data step by step.

Itâ€™s great that I transformed the tables from the website into three CSV files. This makes the data more accessible and usable for further analysis.


**Challenges:**
There were times when I got stuck due to errors and wasn't getting the desired results. However, thanks to Bing Chat, ChatGPT, and some helpful YouTube videos, I was able to understand the coding functions and structure better. I persisted, found helpful resources, and ultimately overcame these challenges.
